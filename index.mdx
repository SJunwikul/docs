## What is ARES?

**ARES** is a cross-app credit wallet that enables your AI application to tap into a new revenue stream. By integrating ARES, you can accept payments from users who prefer pay-per-use credits instead of (or alongside) traditional subscriptions, earning revenue every time ARES users consume your services.

## How It Works

When a user signs in to your app with ARES, you get an access token. Use that token to call our APIs - check their balance, deduct credits, and get paid.

Different auth frameworks (Clerk, Auth0, etc.) handle tokens differently. We have [guides for all of them](/authentication/overview).

**You earn $0.0018 for every credit spent in your app.**

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { Ares } from "ares-sdk";

// Initialize with user's OAuth access token
const client = new Ares({
  accessToken: userOAuthAccessToken,
});

// Check if user has enough credits before providing service
const user = await client.user.retrieve();
console.log(`${user.name} has ${user.credits} credits`);

// Provide your AI service (generation, API call, etc.)
const result = await yourAIService();

// Deduct credits from user's ARES wallet - YOU get paid!
await client.partner.recordUsage({
  client_id: process.env.ARES_CLIENT_ID!,
  credits: 10,
  usage: "AI image generation",
});
```

## Core Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Partner Revenue Model" icon="coins">
    You earn revenue every time an ARES user spends credits in your app. When you call `recordUsage()`, credits are deducted from the user's ARES wallet and you receive payment for the service provided.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="OAuth Access Tokens" icon="key">
  Users authenticate via "Sign in with ARES" (OAuth 2.0). The access token
  represents their ARES account and allows you to check their credit balance and
  deduct credits when they use your services.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Partner Client ID" icon="id-card">
  When you register as an ARES partner, you receive a Client ID and Client
  Secret. These identify your application and enable you to receive revenue from
  ARES users.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Flexible Pricing" icon="chart-line">
  You control your pricing - charge per API call, per generation, per feature,
  or any model that fits your app. ARES handles the credit transactions.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Server-Side Only" icon="server">
    For security, all ARES SDK operations must be performed server-side. Never expose OAuth tokens or Client Secrets in client-side code.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
